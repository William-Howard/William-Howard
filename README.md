### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**William-Howard/William-Howard** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects for class.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Technical writing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything for school, honestly.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Coding.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about pretty much anything history related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: whoward2@stu.jsu.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have broken both my arms at the same time.
